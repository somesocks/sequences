# sequences

## About

`sequences` is a collection of utilities for working with lazily-evaluated
sequences of data in a functional way.  Working with a lazily-evaluated sequence
can often be faster than other ways of working with data, as it minimizes intermediate
memory allocations where possible.

```javascript

// temporary arrays are created by filter and map,
let val = [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]
	.filter((val) => val > 0)
	.map((val) => val + 1)
	.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0);

// no temporary arrays
let val2 = FromArray([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3])
	.pipe(Filter, (val) => val > 0)
	.pipe(Map, (val) => val + 1)
	.pipe(Reduce, (sum, val) => sum + val, 0)
	.read();

```


## Why not ES6 Iterators?

- ES6 Iterators require a temporary `{ done, value }` object to be created with every call, which hurts performance.

- `Sequence().read()` accepts a 'recycle' parameter when called, which allows you to re-use values when possible for even better performance.

- `Sequence().read()` returns the next result or the Sequence terminator, which can simplify code under some circumstances.

## Why ES6 Iterators?

- You want to use the Iterable protocol
